          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <div className="story-content">
            <p>
              AG Media was founded on the recognition that South Sudanese communities—both at home and across 
              the diaspora—needed a media platform that could bridge the gap between ancestral storytelling 
              traditions and modern journalistic standards. We emerged from a commitment to preserve cultural 
              memory while addressing the urgent need for credible, professional documentation of our community's 
              evolving narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike casual creator platforms or community blogs, AG Media operates as a serious institutional 
              endeavor. We combine newsroom discipline with cultural authority, ensuring that every documentary, 
              article, and archive we produce meets rigorous professional standards while honoring the depth and 
              complexity of South Sudanese heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform serves multiple audiences: South Sudanese communities seeking authentic representation, 
              educators and researchers requiring credible sources, policymakers needing cultural context, and 
              global audiences interested in African storytelling. Through this work, we contribute to civic 
              discourse, cultural preservation, and institutional knowledge-building.
